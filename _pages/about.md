I am a PhD candidate in Translation Studies at [School of English Studies](http://www.ses.shisu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/), supervised by Professor [Weiqing Xiao](http://www.ses.shisu.edu.cn/_t8/04/b8/c10882a1208/page.htm). My ongoing PhD project is utilising the eye tracker to explore the translation process of subtitling from English to Chinese.

My research interests includes audiovisual translation (with a focus on subtitling), media accessibility and translation process.
